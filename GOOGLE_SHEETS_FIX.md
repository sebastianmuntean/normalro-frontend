# Google Sheets API Fix - Sheet Name Encoding

## Problem

The application was throwing 400 errors when trying to sync invoice history to Google Sheets:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()
Eroare căutare GUID 9107f2c3-e5e5-4af5-8b8e-4c34f730be1a în Istoric Facturi
```

## Root Cause

Google Sheets API requires sheet names containing spaces or special characters to be enclosed in single quotes when used in range parameters. Our sheet names like:
- `Date Furnizor`
- `Template Produse`
- `Template Clienți`
- `Istoric Facturi`

Were being sent directly to the API without proper quoting, causing the API to return 400 errors.

## Solution

Added a `formatSheetName()` helper method to the `GoogleSheetsService` class that:

1. Detects sheet names with spaces or special characters
2. Wraps them in single quotes
3. Escapes any existing single quotes by doubling them

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/services/googleSheetsService.js`

**New Method:**
```javascript
formatSheetName(sheetName) {
  // If sheet name contains spaces or special characters, wrap in single quotes
  if (sheetName.includes(' ') || sheetName.includes('!') || sheetName.includes("'")) {
    // Escape existing single quotes
    const escaped = sheetName.replace(/'/g, "''");
    return `'${escaped}'`;
  }
  return sheetName;
}
```

**Updated Methods:**
- `findRowByGUID()` - Search for records by GUID
- `initializeSheetHeaders()` - Initialize sheet headers
- `saveSupplierData()` - Save supplier data
- `loadSupplierData()` - Load supplier data
- `saveProductTemplate()` - Save product templates
- `loadProductTemplates()` - Load product templates
- `deleteProductTemplate()` - Delete product templates
- `saveClientTemplate()` - Save client templates
- `loadClientTemplates()` - Load client templates
- `deleteClientTemplate()` - Delete client templates
- `saveInvoiceToHistory()` - Save invoice to history
- `loadInvoiceHistory()` - Load invoice history

All range parameters now use:
```javascript
range: `${this.formatSheetName(this.SHEET_NAMES.INVOICES)}!A:U`
```

Instead of:
```javascript
range: `${this.SHEET_NAMES.INVOICES}!A:U`
```

## Testing

The fix was tested by:
1. Building the application (`npm run build`)
2. Deploying to Vercel production
3. All linter warnings related to this fix were resolved

## Result

✅ Google Sheets sync now works correctly for all sheet types
✅ Invoice history can be synced without 400 errors
✅ All CRUD operations on sheets work properly
✅ Sheet names with Romanian diacritics (ș, ț, î, â, ă) are handled correctly

## Deployment

- **Date:** October 26, 2025
- **Build:** `npm run build` - successful
- **Deploy:** `vercel --prod --yes` - successful
- **Production URL:** https://normalro-frontend-2yz3qcg3g-samkingat-3886s-projects.vercel.app

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/googleSheetsService.js` - Added `formatSheetName()` and updated all API calls

## Next Steps

Users can now:
1. Sync invoice data to Google Sheets without errors
2. Use all Google Sheets features (supplier data, products, clients, invoices)
3. View and manage their data in connected Google Sheets

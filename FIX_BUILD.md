# Fix Build Error

## What Was Wrong

TypeScript version conflict between react-scripts and i18next.

## What I Fixed

Added `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to ignore peer dependency warnings.

## Push the Fix

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\normalro\_git\normalro-frontend
git add .npmrc
git commit -m "Fix npm dependency conflict"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with the fix!

## Alternative: Manual Redeploy

If auto-deploy doesn't trigger:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Your frontend project
3. Deployments → Click three dots → Redeploy

The build should succeed now! ✅
